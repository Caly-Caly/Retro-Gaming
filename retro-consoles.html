            Sega Genesis, also known as the Mega Drive was a 16-bit video
            console created and sold by Sega. This console was release in Japan
            on October 29, 1988. This was Sega's third console which at first
            ranked poorly in Japan due to the popularity of Nintendo's NES;
            however, it became a success in Europe, Brazil, and North America.
            With this console Sega wanted to compete against Nintendo's Super
            Mario franchise and thus created their original character known as
            Sonic the Hedgehog. The Sega Genesis also had
            <strong>amazing action-packed titles</strong> like Night Trap and
            Mortal Kombat, that became a massive hit.
