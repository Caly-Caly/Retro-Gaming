      <h2>Glimps of Gaming Console History</h2>
      <div class="glimps">
        <p>
          Growing up I don't remember a time when I didn't have a gaming device
          in my hands. From gaming with friends, family, or solo playing I
          always enjoyed it. Seeing how I was able to get so immersed in a world
          unlike the one that we live in was and always be truly magical for me.
          Even now, being 24 years old, I still play video games whether it's on
          my PlayStation 5, retro emulators, or on my phone. It's a hobby that I
          will always enjoy and those that also enjoy gaming will agree with me.
          The gaming world has continued to evolve over the decades and will
          with all the new technology that's being built daily; however, this
          wouldn't be possible without these early retro consoles paving the way
          for modern day consoles. Let's take a brief dive at the consoles that
          started this phenomenon!

      <h2>Console History</h2>
      <div class="history">
        <p>
          The history of video game consoles, both home and handheld, had their
          origins in the 1970s. The concept of home consoles used to play games
          on a television set was founded by the 1972 Magnavox Odyssey, first
          conceived by Ralph H. Baer in 1966.
          <br />
          <br />
          Since then, home game consoles have progressed through technology
          cycles typically referred to as generations, each lasting
          approximately five years, during which competing manufacturers have
          produced consoles with similar specifications. With underlying
          improvements to technology such as smaller and faster microprocessors,
          digital communications, and changes to business models, a new
          generation of consoles is evolved from the previous one.

          success in Europe, Brazil, and North America. With this console Sega

          Genesis also had <strong>amazing action-packed titles</strong> like
