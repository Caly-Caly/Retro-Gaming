          Growing up I don't remember a time when I didn't have a gaming device
          in my hands. From gaming with friends, family, or solo playing I
          always enjoyed it. Seeing how I was able to get so immersed in a world
          unlike the one that we live in was and always be truly magical for me.
          Even now, being 24 years old, I still play video games whether it's on
          my PlayStation 5, retro emulators, or on my phone. It's a hobby that I
          will always enjoy and those that also enjoy gaming will agree with me.
          The gaming world has continued to evolve over the decades and will
          with all the new technology that's being built daily; however, this
          wouldn't be possible without these early retro consoles paving the way
          for modern day consoles. Let's take a brief dive at the consoles that
          started this phenomenon!

            The history of video game consoles, both home and handheld, had
            their origins in the 1970s. The concept of home consoles used to
            play games on a television set was founded by the 1972 Magnavox
            Odyssey, first conceived by Ralph H. Baer in 1966. Since then, home
            game consoles have progressed through technology cycles typically
            referred to as generations, each lasting approximately five years,
            during which competing manufacturers have produced consoles with
            similar specifications. With underlying improvements to technology
            such as smaller and faster microprocessors, digital communications,
            and changes to business models, a new generation of consoles is
            evolved from the previous one.
